# GoPaddle


This was my final project for my Automation and Scripting class at Augusta University.

***Please note: The site's underlying HTML has changed and the script no longer works***
But it is still a great example of my scripting and parsing skills

I like whitewater kayaking and rafting!  www.americanwhitewater.org is the site
to check when you want to go paddling. They have put together an amazing website
full of amazing resources, including the current reading on USGS gauges so you
can find out what is "running," or has enough water to go paddling in.

I made this web-scraping script with a few fun bells and whistles, and wanted to
share it with the world.  I may update it in the future with the ability to directly
open URLs, better error handling, and maybe even browser integration.  

Thanks for your interest!  If you want to run it yourself, just download the main
gopaddle.py file, make sure you have Python 3, and run the script! 

See you on the river!
